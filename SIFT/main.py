#For this assignment, you will need to report performance for sift features on two different classifiers:
# 1) Bag of sift features and nearest neighbor classifier
# 2) Bag of sift features and linear SVM classifier

#For simplicity you can define a "num_train_per_cat" vairable, limiting the number of
#examples per category. num_train_per_cat = 100 for intance.

#Sample images from the training/testing dataset. 
#You can limit number of samples by using the n_sample parameter.

''' Step 1: Represent each image with the appropriate feature
 Each function to construct features should return an N x d matrix, where
 N is the number of paths passed to the function and d is the 
 dimensionality of each image representation. See the starter code for
 each function for more details. '''

''' Step 2: Classify each test image by training and using the appropriate classifier
 Each function to classify test features will return an N x l cell array,
 where N is the number of test cases and each entry is a string indicating
 the predicted one-hot vector for each test image. See the starter code for each function
 for more details. '''

# Interpreting your performance with 100 training examples per category:
#  accuracy  =   0 -> Your code is broken (probably not the classifier's
#                     fault! A classifier would have to be amazing to
#                     perform this badly).
#  accuracy ~= .10 -> Your performance is chance. Something is broken or
#                     you ran the starter code unchanged.
#  accuracy ~= .50 -> Rough performance with bag of SIFT and nearest
#                     neighbor classifier. Can reach .60 with K-NN and
#                     different distance metrics.
#  accuracy ~= .60 -> You've gotten things roughly correct with bag of
#                     SIFT and a linear SVM classifier.
#  accuracy >= .70 -> You've also tuned your parameters well. E.g. number
#                     of clusters, SVM regularization, number of patches
#                     sampled when building vocabulary, size and step for
#                     dense SIFT features.
#  accuracy >= .80 -> You've added in spatial information somehow or you've
#                     added additional, complementary image features. This
#                     represents state of the art in Lazebnik et al 2006.
#  accuracy >= .85 -> You've done extremely well. This is the state of the
#                     art in the 2010 SUN database paper from fusing many 
#                     features. Don't trust this number unless you actually
#                     measure many random splits.
#  accuracy >= .90 -> You used modern deep features trained on much larger
#                     image databases.
#  accuracy >= .96 -> You can beat a human at this task. This isn't a
#                     realistic number. Some accuracy calculation is broken
#                     or your classifier is cheating and seeing the test
#                     labels.
